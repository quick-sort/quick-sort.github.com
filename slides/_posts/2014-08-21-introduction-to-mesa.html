                    <ul>
                        <li>Mesa is geo-replicated across multiple datacenters and provides consistent and repeatable query answers at low latency, even when an entire datacenter fails</li>
                        <li>Mesa is designed to satisfy near real-time data ingestion and queryability, as well as high availability, reliability, fault tolerance, and scalability for large data and query volumes</li>
                        <li>Mesa handles petabytes of data, processes millions of row updates per second, and serves billions of queries that fetch trillions of rows per day</li>

                        <li>None of Google’s other in-house data solutions(BigTable, Megastore,Spanner,F1) can support the data size and update volume required to serve as a data warehousing platform supporting Google’s advertising business</li>

                    <q>Mesa performs a linked schema change to han- dle this case by treating the old and new schema versions as one for update/compaction. Specifically, Mesa makes the schema change visible to new queries immediately, handles conversion to the new schema version at query time on the fly (using a default value for the new column), and similarly writes all new deltas for the table in the new schema version</q>

                        <li>Mesa also runs a global aggregate value checker that computes the spanning set of the most recently committed version of every index of a table in every Mesa instance, reads the aggregate values of those deltas from metadata, and aggregates them appropriately to verify consistency across all indexes and instances</li>
